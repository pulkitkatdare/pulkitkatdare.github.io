    <h1>Trust Region Policy Optimization Explained</h1>
    <article>
        <p>Recently, I have been trying to get into Deep Reinforcement learning and one of the imporant papers for a continuous control that generally crops up in the paper on <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05477.pdf">Trust Region Policy Optimization</a>. <br>
        It is important to mention here that there are two types of networks mentioned in the paper. One is the policy function $\pi$. which generates appropriate stochastic policy and other network is specifically dedicated to generating the Value function in the problem.
