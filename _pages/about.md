I am final year phd student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu) department at [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu). I am currently a part of the Human Centered Autonomy Lab advised by Prof. [Katherine Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu). My research primarily focuses on developing algorithms for reliable offline validation and offline learning to enable their commercial deployment over a wide-variety of tasks. This vision also allows me to dabble with different machine learning modules involving generative models and language models.

Previously, I finished my undergraduate and masters in mechanical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My masters thesis focuses on utlizing tenets of geometric control theory to manipulate complex systems across a manifold.

Research interests:

- Reinforcement Learning
- Learning-based Robotics
- Off-Policy Evaluation
- Language Model Pre-Training
- Generative Models
